	<h1>Power of Dreams</h1>
	
	<h2>Who are you?</h2>
	<p>When was the last time you talked to yourself? Hey, come on I am not talking about the uncheerful and sad melodies of your heart.
	I am talking about the time when 
	you talked to yourself wih high self esteem and a lot of positivity.When was that?.In order to uncover who we are and why we act the way we do, we have to know our own story. Being brave and willing to explore our past is an important stepping stone on the road to understanding ourselves and becoming who we want to beTake some time to create a timeline of where you have been in the world, who you have shared experiences with, and how those experiences and places have left a mark on your life.</p>

	<p>We humans are quite amusing. Being the "only" animal that is capable of "intelligent" thought, they have often wondered much about things that are largely out of their control. When they popped into existence and didn't know why, they created a divine force and said it was to blame. When there was weather, they wondered why, and concluded that the divine force was in charge of that, too. And when nature creates a genetically mutated freakish bunny, well I'll be darned, the almighty divine force did that too.Free will shapes   your destiny because the choices you make influence how and when you learn the lessons you are destined to learn and have the experiences you are destined to experience. The choices you make along the way simply impact the route you toward that pot of gold.  There is not just one route to get there are many paths that you could possibly take</p>
	
	<h2>Chase your heart</h2>

	<p>Many people fail to understand themselfves. Were your dreams injected into you by someone else or it was something what your heart said you want?
	Or didn't start dreaming yet.No,I don't believe that.Definitely you have a dream,But you didn't realise it yet. Each of us have a dream inside our heart.
	It draws on our talents and gifts. It appeals to our highest ideals. It sparks our feelings of destiny. It is inseparably linked to our purpose in life.
	Everyone has the ability to dream, but not everyone has the willingness to truly chase their dreams.Dream chasing is for those who dare to take a chance to believe, that their dream is something more, than a thought or possibility.

	<h2>Do you think you failed</h2>

	<p>It is okay to cry.You cry because you are a human. You may seem to fail infront of the ugly eyes of the society but never let you fail yourself.
	Lift up your spirits like never before.Each time you fail jump higher with more energy.This is your life.Trust me,no one can put a full stop on your 
	dreams exept you.If you are ready to run. <strong>Run Run Run</strong> . Run till you fall and get back on track as soon as possible..Because far ahead what is waiting
	you is not just your dreams,it is what you are destined to do. And my definition to this energy packet is<em> Hope</em>.</p>
