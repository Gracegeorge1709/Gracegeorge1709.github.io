<p>Arabica is the most popular type of coffee, hands down. Depending on who you ask, many coffee enthusiasts prefer using Arabica beans due to its taste. Typically used for black coffee, Arabica beans have a sweeter, more complex flavor that you can drink straight. Funny thing is, even though it’s the most popular, it doesn’t have as much caffeine as Robusta.</p>
<h2>Robusta</h2>

<p>While Arabica is the most popular, Robusta is cheaper and stronger. Because of its bitter flavor, you’ll typically see Robusta used for espresso drinks and in instant coffee mixes. If your Monday morning is lagging, reach for a cup of coffee that uses Robusta beans. Their high caffeine content will wake you right up!Robusta has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa.[1] It is easy to care for, has a greater crop yield, has almost double the amount of caffeine and more antioxidants,[11] and is less susceptible to disease than arabica coffea.[10] It represents 43% of global coffee production, with arabica constituting the remainder except for the 1% constituted by coffea liberica.</p>
<h2>Black Coffee</h2>

<p>Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,[5] and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee[6] (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. </p>
