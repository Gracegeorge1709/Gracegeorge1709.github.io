	<p>When grinding your coffee beans with a mortar and pestle, you'll want to be careful not to crush them into un-filterable dust. You'll need about two tablespoons of grinds per cup you want to brew. If you can fit it into your mortar, add as many beans as you need all at once.</p>

		<li>Burr Grinders</li>

Baratza conical burr coffee grinder. We love them. Burr from a coffee grinder.For a step up in precision, now we're moving in the right direction, tally-ho! Burr grinders are the answer to a more perfect union of bean and grind. Disk (a.k.a. plate) and conical burr grinders are your basic choices. Flat disk grinders use two spinning disks to smash the coffee into precise uniform grinds. Precision is good for home use; you can even get a truly fine espresso grind. But, alas, they can also run hot and, if not careful, can scorch the beans.
Conical Burr Grinders

These are a bit more expensive, but are the choice of both coffee professionals and enthusiasts alike and well worth the price. These are the workhorses. Precision grinds, even for Turkish coffee, and a slow, cool motor.

Hand Grinders

Manual hand coffee grinder with drawer.If youâ€™re both counting pennies and are also in need of a way to work out your flabby upper arms, perhaps you could try a hand grinder. They work on the same principle, except your arm substitutes for an electric motor. Watch those biceps bulge! The trouble here is that it takes an awful lot of effort to get even a small brew under way and in that time you could be drinking coffee.
